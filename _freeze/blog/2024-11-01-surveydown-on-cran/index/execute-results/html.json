With the release of v0.4.0, surveydown is now on CRAN ðŸŽ‰!\n\nYou can now install surveydown from CRAN using the usual `install.packages()` function:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"surveydown\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nWhile this is a nice convenience, I also wanted to take the opportunity in this blog post to highlight some of the improvements and new features made in v0.4.0.\n\n## New functions / features\n\nWe added a whole bunch of new functions and features since v0.3.0. \n\nIn `sd_question()`, we added a new `type = \"matrix\"` to support matrix type questions. \n\nWe added a new `sd_is_answered()` function to check if a question is answered or not. This is useful for conditional reactive questions.\n\nWe added two new helper functions, `sd_add_question()` and `sd_add_page()`, to instantly create question and page templates. \n\nWe also added a new `sd_completion_code()` function to allow users to define a completion code for their surveys.\n\nWe also added a new `sd_close()` function to close the survey.\n\n## Performance improvements \n\nWe streamlined survey updating. Before you needed to render the `survey.qmd` file yourself, but now you don't ever need to render it. \n\nWe also improved the database updating to be much more efficient.\n\n## Our first community contributions!\n\nUpdated `sd_output()` to now be able to output the chosen question values, chosen question option label(s), and the question label itself. Addresses feature request #128.\n\n- Enhance: `sd_server()` now has a new parameter called `auto_scroll`. It's default to `TRUE`, which enables auto scrolling that tracks the user's input, can be turned off by changing to `FALSE`.
