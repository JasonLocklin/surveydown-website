The basic concept is this:

1.  Design your survey as a [Quarto shiny
    document](https://quarto.org/docs/dashboards/interactivity/shiny-r.html)
    using markdown and R code.
2.  Render your doc into a [shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) app that can
    be hosted online and sent to respondents.
3.  Store your survey responses in a [supabase](https://supabase.com/)
    database.

# Editing a surveydown survey

We recommend working with an IDE to edit your surveydown surveys. [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/categories/rstudio-ide/) is great, and we also like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and [Positron](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron).

Once you have a survey ready to edit in your favorite IDE, you can render it locally to see how it will look as you change features. For example, this gif shows what it looks like to [make a question required](config.qmd#required-responses):
