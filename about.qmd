**surveydown** is a flexible platform for making surveys with three open source technologies: [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), [shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/), and
[supabase](https://supabase.com/). The package is still in development, but you can already use it to create surveys!

The basic concept is this:

1.  Design your survey as a [Quarto shiny
    document](https://quarto.org/docs/dashboards/interactivity/shiny-r.html)
    using markdown and R code.
2.  Render your doc into a [shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) app that can
    be hosted online and sent to respondents.
3.  Store your survey responses in a [supabase](https://supabase.com/)
    database.

We recommend reading the [Getting Started](getting-started.qmd) page to get a sense of how to use surveydown. The rest of the documentation covers more details on how to use surveydown.
