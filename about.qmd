The surveydown project is led by professor [John Paul Helveston](https://www.jhelvy.com/) at George Washington University and was originally developed in collaboration with his students [Pingfan Hu](https://pingfanhu.com) and [Bogdan Bunea](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bogdanbt/). 

As an open-source package, surveydown now has many more contributors who have added features and improved the project over time. See the [**Contributors' Page**](https://github.com/surveydown-dev/surveydown/graphs/contributors) for details.
