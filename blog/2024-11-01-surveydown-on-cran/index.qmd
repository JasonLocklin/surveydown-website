We have some exciting news to share! With the release of v0.4.0, surveydown is now on CRAN ðŸŽ‰!

You can now install surveydown from CRAN using the usual `install.packages()` function:

```{r}
install.packages("surveydown")
```

While this is a nice convenience, I also wanted to take the opportunity in this blog post to highlight some of the improvements and new features made in v0.4.0.

## New functions / features

We added a whole bunch of new functions and features since v0.3.0. 

In `sd_question()`, we added a new `type = "matrix"` to support matrix type questions. 

We added a new `sd_is_answered()` function to check if a question is answered or not. This is useful for conditional reactive questions.

We added two new helper functions, `sd_add_question()` and `sd_add_page()`, to instantly create question and page templates. 

We also added a new `sd_completion_code()` function to allow users to define a completion code for their surveys.

We also added a new `sd_close()` function to close the survey.

## Performance improvements 

We streamlined survey updating. Before you needed to render the `survey.qmd` file yourself, but now you don't ever need to render it. 

We also improved the database updating to be much more efficient.

## Our first community contributions!

Updated `sd_output()` to now be able to output the chosen question values, chosen question option label(s), and the question label itself. Addresses feature request #128.

- Enhance: `sd_server()` now has a new parameter called `auto_scroll`. It's default to `TRUE`, which enables auto scrolling that tracks the user's input, can be turned off by changing to `FALSE`. Thanks to the contribution from [Zain Hoda](https://github.com/zainhoda1).
