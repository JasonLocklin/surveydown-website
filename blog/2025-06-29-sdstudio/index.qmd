### Interface Overview

The **sdstudio** interface is organized into three main tabs that follow the natural survey workflow:

- **üèóÔ∏è Build**: Visual survey creation with templates and drag-and-drop functionality
- **üëÅÔ∏è Preview**: Real-time survey testing and responsive design preview
- **üìä Responses**: Data collection, analytics, and export capabilities

Each tab is designed to be intuitive while providing access to advanced features when needed.

## Build Tab - Visual Survey Creation

The Build tab is where the magic happens. This is your visual survey construction workspace, designed to make survey creation as intuitive as using a word processor while maintaining the power and flexibility of code-based approaches.

### Template Gallery

One of **sdstudio**'s standout features is its comprehensive template library. With 15 professionally designed templates, you can start with a solid foundation rather than building from scratch:

**Basic Templates:**
- Default survey structure
- Question type demonstrations
- YAML-based configurations

**Advanced Templates:**
- Conditional logic examples
- Randomized option presentations
- Reactive question flows

**Specialized Templates:**
- Conjoint experiments
- Interactive maps
- Live polling systems

<!-- **PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot of the template selection interface**

   survey types. Highlight the visual diversity and professional appearance 
   of the templates. -->

### Dual-Pane Editor

The heart of the Build tab is the dual-pane editor system that provides the best of both worlds:

**Visual Builder (Left Pane):**
- Drag-and-drop interface for question arrangement
- Point-and-click question creation and editing
- Visual preview of survey flow
- Intuitive question type selection

**Code Editor (Right Pane):**
- Full ACE editor integration with syntax highlighting
- Real-time code synchronization
- Direct code editing for advanced users
- Immediate validation and error detection

The synchronization between these panes is seamless - changes in the visual builder instantly update the code, and code modifications immediately reflect in the visual interface.

<!-- **PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot of the dual-pane editor**
