You can deploy shiny apps to other hosting services. Here are some guides for several other alternatives:

- [Posit Connect Cloud](https://docs.posit.co/connect-cloud/how-to/r/shiny-r.html)
- [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-sdks-docker-shiny#shiny-for-r)
- [Heroku](https://medium.com/@gracemwendemicheni/deploy-r-shiny-app-to-heroku-31b48fb6eb39)

You can also install [Posit Connect](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/connect/) on your own server, which is the [recommended approach](https://docs.posit.co/shinyapps.io/guide/security_and_compliance/index.html) for remaining compliant with any security protocols your organization requires.
