Every surveydown survey is composed of a _survey_ and an _app_, defined in two separate files:

- **survey.qmd**: A Quarto document that contains the survey content (pages, questions, etc), which renders to an HTML file.
- **app.R**: An R script defining a Shiny app that contains the global settings (libraries, database configuration, etc.) and server configuration options (e.g., conditional page skipping / question display, etc.).

These files must be named **survey.qmd** and **app.R**.
