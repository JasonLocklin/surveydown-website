In surveydown, surveys are designed using markdown and R code in a single [Quarto]({{< var url_quarto >}}) document (a `.qmd` file). There is no GUI or drag-and-drop interface - simply write plain text (markdown & R code) and boom - you have a survey!

The [{surveydown}]({{< var url_package >}}) R package provides a set of functions for defining the survey content and configuration options. Each function starts with `sd_` to make them easy to identify.

The platform is based on some basic principles:

- Add content to your survey using markdown text (or in RStudio use the visual editor).
- Define survey questions in R code chunks with the `sd_question()` function.
- Define pages using fences (`:::`), with navigation buttons handled using the `sd_next()` function.
- Add rich functionality to your survey in the server code chunk (the last code chunk at the bottom of the .qmd file), including complex [configuration options](config.qmd) with the `sd_config()` function, and the [database settings](database.qmd) with the `sd_database()` function.
