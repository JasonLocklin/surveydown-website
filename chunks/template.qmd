In the R console, run the following to to setup a template survey:

```{r}
surveydown::sd_create_survey("path/to/folder")
```

This will create a folder located at `"path/to/folder"` with the following files:

- `survey.qmd`: a template survey where you define your survey content (text, questions, images, etc.).
- `app.R`: a template app file where you define your database, survey configuration options, and any other server logic.
- `example.Rproj`: An RStudio project file (helpful if you're working in RStudio)

Every survey created with {surveydown} should be in its own separate project folder.
