## Basic Syntax

Use the `sd_question_custom()` function to create custom questions. The function requires the following arguments:

- `id`: A unique identifier for the question, which will be used as the variable name in the resulting survey data.
- `label`: The label that will be displayed on the question in the survey.
- `output`: The output widget like `leafletOutput()`, `plotOutput()`, etc.
- `value`: The value to be returned by the question.
- `height` (optional): The height of the question in pixels, defaults to 400.

Below is the basic syntax for creating a custom question:

```r
sd_question_custom(
  id     = "some_id",
  label  = "Some Label",
  output = "some_output_widget",
  value  = "some_value"
)
```
In coorperation with `sd_question_custom()`, we also need to define the `output` and the observer function, along with some helpful values, UIs, etc.

## Example of `leaflet`

See the [demo survey](https://github.com/surveydown-dev/demos/tree/main/leaflet-map) of a leaflet map utilizing the `sd_question_custom` function.

The map question looks like this:

<center>
<img src="images/screenshots/leaflet.png" style="max-width: 800px; width: 100%;">
</center>

## Example of `plotly`

See the [demo survey](https://github.com/surveydown-dev/demos/tree/main/plotly) of a plotly question utilizing the `sd_question_custom` function.

The plotly question looks like this:

<center>
<img src="images/screenshots/plotly.png" style="max-width: 800px; width: 100%;">
</center>
