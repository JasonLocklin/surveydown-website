## How do I make a question required?

Use the `required_questions` argument in `sd_config()` to control required responses.
See [making a question required](config-options.qmd#required-responses).

## Why my shinyapps deployment fail?

Firstly, make sure everything is correctly defined, including your Supabase project settings, your password settings, etc. Then, make sure it runs correctly on your local machine and can successfully link with your Supabase table. With these confirmed, your shinyapps deployment should go through without problem.

However, if you still encounter error (maybe the page shows the app failed to start, or you see the page but it doesn't run properly), please find a way to clear your cache. The simplest way to do so is to reboot your computer. It may also help if you delete the previously generated html file, rsconnect folder, and the survey folder generated by qmd rendering.
