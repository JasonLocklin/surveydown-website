## Install R & Quarto

You need both: 

- Install {{< var rproject >}}
- Install {{< var quarto >}}

We also recommend working with an IDE that has good support for R, Quarto, and Shiny.

{{< var rstudio_ide >}} is great, and we also like {{< var vscode >}} and {{< var positron >}}.

## Install the {surveydown} R package

The {surveydown} R package is not yet on CRAN, but you can install the development version from GitHub with the following command in your R console:

```{r}
#| eval: false

# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak('surveydown-dev/surveydown')
```

You can also check which version you have installed:

```{r}
#| eval: false

surveydown::sd_version()
```
