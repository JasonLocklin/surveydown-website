## Install R & Quarto

You need both: 

- Install {{< var rproject >}}
- Install {{< var quarto >}}

We also recommend working with an IDE that has good support for R, Quarto, and Shiny.

{{< var rstudio_ide >}} is great, and we also like {{< var vscode >}} and {{< var positron >}}.

## Install the {surveydown} R package

The {surveydown} R package is not yet on CRAN, but you can install the development version from GitHub with the following command in your R console:

```{r}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("surveydown-dev/surveydown")
```

## Version Control

We made some R functions to make it easier to keep your R package.

To _check_ which version of the {surveydown} package you have installed, run:

```{r}
surveydown::sd_version()
```

To _update_ to the latest version of the {surveydown} package, run:

```{r}
surveydown::sd_update()
```
