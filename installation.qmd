## Install R & Quarto

You need both: 

- [Install {{< fa brands r-project >}}]({{< var url_rproject >}})
- [Install Quarto]({{< var url_quarto >}})

Also, we recommend working with an IDE. [RStudio]({{< var url_rstudio_ide >}}) is great, and we also like [VS Code]({{< var url_vscode >}}) and [Positron]({{< var url_positron >}}).

## Install the {surveydown} R package

The {surveydown} R package is not yet on CRAN, but you can install the development version from GitHub with the following command in your R console:

```{r}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("surveydown-dev/surveydown")
```

## Version Control

We made some R functions to make it easier to keep your R package.

To _check_ if you have the latest R package extension installed, run:

```{r}
surveydown::sd_version()
```

To _update_ the R package to the latest version, run:

```{r}
surveydown::sd_update()
```
