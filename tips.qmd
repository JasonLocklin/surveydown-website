This page has some helpful suggestions for working with surveydown surveys.

## Splitting the server chunk into a separate file

The server chunk contains the following components:

1.  The reactive questions: `sd_question(reactive = TRUE)`.
2.  Database setup: `sd_database()`. This defines your Supabase connection.
3.  Config setup: `sd_config()`. This defines skipping and showing logic, required questions, showing all pages, and the admin page.

As your survey context grows, you may have a survey with a lengthy server chunk, it can be helpful to split it into into a separate file so that you can open it in a separate tab in your editor. This prevents the need to have to scroll up and down to find the server code.

For example, you might have a `server.R` file in your project directory. You could then source it into your survey in the appropriate chunks, like this:

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| context: server

source("server.R")

sd_server(
  input   = input,
  output  = output,
  session = session,
  config  = config,
  db      = db
)
```

With this setup, all of your server settings should be in the `server.R` file.

Note that you still need to include the `sd_server()` function in your server code chunk after sourcing the `server.R` file.
